## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Chosen for maintainability and testability
- **Entity Framework Core**: Selected for ORM capabilities and ease of use
- **React Query**: Implemented for efficient state management and caching
- **In-Memory Database**: Used for development and testing simplicity

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient mapping with AutoMapper
- Optimized React components with proper key usage
- Minimal API surface with focused endpoints

### Security Measures
- Input validation on both client and server
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Type-safe operations throughout the stack
